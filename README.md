Built in Octave.

So, turns out that simple neural networks aren't that great for classifying images. I learned a lot about image processing in this stage of the project, but realized that my learning model had to change.

After attaining a maximum test set accuracy of around 70%, I have suspended this repo in favor of the new "[Monopoly-Assister-CNN](https://github.com/wertyyyy12/Monopoly-Assister-CNN)" repo. I will be using a convolutional neural network instead of a regular multilayer perceptron. 













(Domi, if you're reading this, you will be happy to hear that the new repo uses Python)
